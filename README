Magento Module: Netzarbeiter/NicerImageNames
Author: Vinai Kopp <vinai@netzarbeiter.com>


USAGE

This small extension lets you specify how the product images filenames
should be built. Customers saving images then always can have neat
descriptive image names, and you don't have to do the work before
uploading them.

The way image names are build can be specified in the configuration under
System / Configurataion / Catalog / Nicer Image Names

It works like this example map:
  netzarbeiter.de-%manufacturer-%sku
The %manufacturer will be replaced with the products manufacturer, the %sku with
the products sku.
You can use any attribute that returns a scalar value (string, integer, float, boolean)
Simply prefix the attribute code with a %
All other parts of the map will be left just like they are.

Thanks to t3pke from http://www.keurigonline.nl/ for whom I created the extension for
letting me share it!

KNOWN BUGS:
- None! :D
